# Indy.Code-2017
Slides and demos from 2017 Indy.Code()

**Note for TDD Demos** I removied the NPM packages from the demos to reduce the size of the demo. Before you run them, you will need to go into each directory and run "npm install" to restore them.

**Note for Jest Demo in TDD Talk** If you were in the session, you may remember the first demo was throwing weird errors when I tried to run the tests. I tracked this down to an issue with my local NPM installation. If you run into this problem locally, use the "jest" command instead of "NPM test"
